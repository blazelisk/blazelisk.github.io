                      <p><strong>Hi, I'm Benjamin Bui.</strong> I love exploring both how evolving technology changes how we model and analyze the increasingly complex systems present in the world. Automation and technological innovation have the potential for fundamental change in a variety of core ideas in economics such as price discrimination and labor markets which warrants further investigation. It is this intersection of technology, economics, and their effects on human lives that is my primary field of interest. </p>
                      <p> After receiving my undergraduate degree, I began to pursue a Master's in Education from Johns Hopkins School Education. Although I found the work in education to be very emotionally rewarding, I found myself missing the life of research. I am now interested in pursuing a career more aligned with my personal interests in rigorous research.</p>
